# Study Vault

## This project is intended to make not only note taking & note reading easy ,but your life easy as well .I created this project because I was tired of jotting down notes the old fashioned way ,pen & paper .This style made it not just more efficient and faster but also pretty fun and enjoyable to the view as well .I developed this webpage following steps that were provided to me by a module in my prework course .This webpage takes away your boring old fashioned notebook & all that flipping through endless pages of hand written notes ,OUCH! .In the process of this webpage developmnet I learned that it wasn't only about me jotting down my notes and making my life easier but trying to make something more exciting ,fun & less boring for the next student that comes after me .
