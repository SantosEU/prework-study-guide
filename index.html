<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
  <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
  <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration.Declarations are not case-sensitive,HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
  <li>!DOCTYPE HTML declaration ,this tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
  <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en",which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case ,en for English)</li>
  <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginninig element,never the closing element.</li>
  <li>Metdata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
  <li>title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
  <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing.Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
  <li>style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
  <li>base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
  <li>link element connects an external reesource to the HTML document.</li>
  <li>meta element defines metadata such as the character set,description,keywords,author,& viewport.</li>
  <li>script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
  <li>the meta element defines the charset, or the character set,as UTF-8,which allows us to use most characters & symbols on the page.</li>
<li>At the end you see the /head closing tag.</li>
<li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.If there are three elements nested inside of a body element,those three nested elements are known as the child elements.The element that holds all the children-in this case,the body element is known as the parent element.This parent/child language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elemnets in HTML.</li>
<li>body element defines the body of the document,which contains the content that is visible to the user.</li>
<li>In sematic HTML elements,the name of the element describes its content & the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
<li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page,or span to create an inline division.</li>
<li>When working with visible HTML elements,the content is contained between an opening tag & a closing tag.These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside (for example,head) ,closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, /head).We insert the content between an opening tag & a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content. </li>
<li>The words "element" & "tag" are commonly used in the web development world,but there is a difference.An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
<li>The h1,h2,h3,h4,h5, & h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
<li>p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
<li>ul,ol, & li elements represent unordered lists,ordered lists, & list items.</li>
<li>img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
<li>src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
<li>br element creates a line of empty space,or a line break,between two blocks of content.</li>
<li>a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
<li>href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
<li>footer appears at the bottom of the pages & usually contains the author,copyright,contact,sitemap & navigation.</li>
<li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
<li>HTML uses the id attribbute as a way to identify elements & select them.</li>
