<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
  <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
  <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration.Declarations are not case-sensitive,HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
  <li>!DOCTYPE HTML declaration ,this tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
  <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en",which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case ,en for English)</li>
  <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginninig element,never the closing element.</li>
  <li>Metdata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
  <li>title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
  <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing.Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
  <li>style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
  <li>base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
  <li>link element connects an external reesource to the HTML document.</li>
  <li>meta element defines metadata such as the character set,description,keywords,author,& viewport.</li>
  <li>script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
  <li>the meta element defines the charset, or the character set,as UTF-8,which allows us to use most characters & symbols on the page.</li>
<li>At the end you see the /head closing tag.</li>
<li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.If there are three elements nested inside of a body element,those three nested elements are known as the child elements.The element that holds all the children-in this case,the body element is known as the parent element.This parent/child language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elemnets in HTML.</li>
<li>body element defines the body of the document,which contains the content that is visible to the user.</li>
<li>In sematic HTML elements,the name of the element describes its content & the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
<li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page,or span to create an inline division.</li>
<li>When working with visible HTML elements,the content is contained between an opening tag & a closing tag.These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside (for example,head) ,closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, /head).We insert the content between an opening tag & a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content. </li>
<li>The words "element" & "tag" are commonly used in the web development world,but there is a difference.An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
<li>The h1,h2,h3,h4,h5, & h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
<li>p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
<li>ul,ol, & li elements represent unordered lists,ordered lists, & list items.</li>
<li>img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
<li>src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
<li>br element creates a line of empty space,or a line break,between two blocks of content.</li>
<li>a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
<li>href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
<li>footer appears at the bottom of the pages & usually contains the author,copyright,contact,sitemap & navigation.</li>
<li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
<li>HTML uses the id attribbute as a way to identify elements & select them.</li>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file,they use inline CSS.</li>
  <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>
  <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
<li>a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
<li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
<li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
<li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
<li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
<li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
<li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
<li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
<li>every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. </li>
<li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
<li>we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
<li>the h1 and h2 rule assignment is a positioning property, text-align. This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
<li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
<li>link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
<li>rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location</li>
<li>he period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
<li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
<li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
<li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
<li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
